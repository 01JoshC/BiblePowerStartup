        Studying the Bible every day isn’t always easy. That’s why we created DailyBread—a web application designed to help users grow spiritually through consistent scripture study. DailyBread motivates daily reading with a streak counter, leaderboards, league advancement, and other engaging gamified features. Think of it as the “Duolingo” for the Bible—making scripture study rewarding, interactive, and spiritually uplifting.
